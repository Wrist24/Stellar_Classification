# Stellar_Classification
The goal of this project is to classify stellar objects (quasars, galaxies or stars) into their respective category by analyzing the properties of each object.
The dataset contains information for different colored light filters, ascension angles and more.
Libraries used for this research include, but are not limited to:
numpy, for preparing the data for classification;
matplotlib for various plots and visualisations of the relationships between the data;
sklearn for various preprocessings and encodings;
keras for building the neural networks.
Classifiers used from sklearn: Random forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, XGBoost.
